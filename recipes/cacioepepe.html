    <p>
        Dive deep enough through the internet and there is an international day, week or month for everything.. and that even includes cheese wheels! Seriously, look it up :)

        It may be tough to get your hands on a cheese wheel but if you can this recipe is a show stopper.
        
        If using packet pasta, the cook time is significantly reduced to around 20 minutes.

        <li>20 g semolina</li>
        <li>2 whole eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <h3>For the Fresh Pasta</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Weigh out 180 g of 00 flour and 20 g of semolina flour</li>
        <li>Make mound of flour on work surface and make a well with the egg</li>
        <li>Crack 2 wholes eggs into well</li>

    <h3> For the Sauce</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Cook the fresh made pasta for 2 minutes, if using packet pasta cook until al dente</li>
        <li>Combine the finely grated cheese and Â½ a cup of pasta water in a bowl and mix completely</li>
        <li>Add pasta directly into pan, all that starchy water helps with the sauce</li>
        <li>Swirl around so that the pasta is completely coated in peppercorns, turn the heat off</li>
        <li>Add the cheese mixture to pan and mix in very well.</li>
        <li>At this stage you will need to add more pasta water so just ladle it out of the pot</li>
        <li>You are looking for a nice silky, saucy consistency</li>
        <li>Serve immediately</li>
    </ol>
